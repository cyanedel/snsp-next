This is a standard [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

If you have developed an app utilizing Next Js before, you should know how to run it.

## Note about Mockup API
Mockup API source: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/
All API routes should work as described in the mockup API guide, except the "add comment" which I thought should be available but is not.

## Other Notes
1. I initially wrote this using NodeJs 20.11.0. Module behavior might vary, depending on which node js you're using.
2. This is my first time setting up jest. Seems like it runs into an issue when trying to test the page with fetch API. No time to fix this. Will leave it as is.
